RAINBOW TROUT IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Please place your rainbow trout image in this directory and name it exactly:
rainbow_trout.jpg

The image should be:
- High quality (at least 800px wide)
- JPG or JPEG format (PNG will also work if you update the Home.js file accordingly)
- Showing a rainbow trout clearly
- Properly licensed for your use (free stock image, your own photo, or with appropriate attribution)

Once you add the image, it will automatically display on the home page of the application.

If you're having trouble with the image displaying:
1. Make sure the filename is exactly "rainbow_trout.jpg" (case sensitive)
2. Check that it's placed directly in this directory
3. Restart the development server (npm start)
